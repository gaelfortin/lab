<h2> DigestMayo </h2>
DigestMayo allows you to design double digestions in a more efficient way. Its first practical application is to verify that a cloning worked. <br>
To do so, insert your DNA sequences in 'VECTOR.txt' and 'CONSTRUCTION.txt'. Your set of available enzymes should be located in 'ENZYMES.txt'. <br>

<h2> Fire(d)Cloning</h2>
Fire(d)Cloning designs cloning experiments in a few minuts. Put your backbones' sequences in the 'backbones.txt' file and the plasmid sequence from which to take the insert in 'insert.txt'. Your set of enzymes will be used to design the experiment.<br>
After giving cloning positions, the software will finally give you couples of enzymes that you can use to perform the cloning. <br>

<b>Fire(d)Cloning required positions:</b>
